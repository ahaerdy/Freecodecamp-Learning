## Step 1 

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage. This is your code editor, where you'll write HTML.

Find line 1 in the editor and type this text:

```
Welcome to freeCodeCamp
```

When you are done, click the "check your code" button to see if it's correct.

## Step 2

HTML is made up of elements. The first one you will use is the h1 element:

```
<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>
```

It starts with an opening tag (`<h1>`), ends with a closing tag (`</h1>`), and has the text it will display in between the tags.

Turn your Welcome to freeCodeCamp text into an h1 element by adding an opening tag in front of it, and a closing tag after it.
